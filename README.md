# weather-sensors-anomaly-detection

This project is about performing anomaly detection on a set of data collected by CityProbe weather sensors around the city of Aalborg, Denmark.  Anomaly detection was to be performed by making use of time series forecast, speciﬁcally a seasonal ARIMA prediction model.  The attached report documents the design, implementation and evaluation stages of the ARIMA model and the anomaly detection model it is to be used for.  It is concluded that the model fulﬁlls the requirements set forth in the problem statement, but that there is potential for improvement, e.g. improving the seasonal ARIMA prediction model to use the multivariate features of the sensor data set.
